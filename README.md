# IFB104_Assignment
First year software engineering python assignment

####Task - 1

This assignment tests your skills at defining functions, processing
data stored in lists and performing the arithmetic calculations
necessary to display a complex visual image.  The incomplete
Python script below is missing a crucial function, "paste_up".
You are required to complete this function so that when the
program is run it produces an image of an advertising billboard
whose arrangement is determined by data stored in a list which
specifies how individual paper sheets are to be pasted onto the
backing.  See the instruction sheet accompanying this file for
full details.

####Task - 2 

To complete this task you must modify your solution to Part A so that it draws a graffiti “tag”
on any billboard which has an ‘X’ at the start of the data set used to create it. The graffito must
cover the whole billboard and must be a tag consisting of your initials, at least two. You can
include additional graffiti if desired, but your initials must be the dominate part. The initials
must be drawn with the “turtle” cursor, not printed, to look as if they were spray painted across
the billboard. You may not use Turtle’s write function to print the initials
